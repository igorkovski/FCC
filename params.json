{"name":"My Work @ FreeCodeCamp","tagline":"An Online JavaScript Coding Bootcamp","body":"# Igor Welcomes You!\r\nThanks so much for visiting! I'm so glad you're here. This page reflects the work I'm doing while attending FreeCodeCamp, an online JavaScript Coding Bootcamp. As we started the curriculum, we worked on some basic HTML/CSS problems by putting together a demo app within the browser. Afterwards it was all about scripting. We were given a problem to solve and we had to work on it either by ourselves, if that was our choice, or pair program with another FCC student. Having said that, this is exactly where I am currently.  I am finishing up some basic algorithm scripting.  You can find all of the scripts I wrote so far in the basicalgorithms.js file.\r\n\r\nI will be updating the page throughout my time at the bootcamp, so there's more to come!","google":"UA-68801009-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
