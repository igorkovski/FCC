# FreeCodeCamp (FCC) Basic-Advanced Algorithm Scripting and other Challenges

####This repository has some of the work I have done while a student at FreeCodeCamp

The challenges were presented as part of the curriculum.  

* The community at FCC is one of the best for learning JavaScript and for those aspiring at becoming Full Stack Developers
* It takes 800 hours to get through the entire curriculum.
* After you complete the challenges, you are paired up with a non-profit where you assist for another 800 hours
* The challenges, algorithm practice, and the ability to build a personal portfolio is what makes this the best free code camp.
